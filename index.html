		<h2>Music Visualizer </h1>

			<div>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p> For my final project I'm going to create a music visualizer that will help visualize music that is being play in real time. Basically the program will regcognize the music through  frequency, rythm, tempo, bass, loudness and it will randomly generate a visual base on those elements and synchronize it with the music. I will also add features that can allow user to interact with the program as well, such as: webcam, importing their own picture, mouse click and keyboard. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
			<h3> Motivation</h3>
			<p1> My motivation to making this program is that I really like the fact that we can generate random visual through code, the randomness will help make the visual much more unexpected and thrilling rather than creating a story line by myself. Plus I've always been wanting to learn code so that I can create visual for electronic music. Also there are only a few online music visualizer out there right now, the rest are program that you have to buy. So I want to create something that is free and can be accessible by everyone</p1>
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3> Outcome</h3>

			<p2> I want the audience to know about the history of electronic music that goes hand in hand with music visualizer. I want the audience to experience eletronic music in a different way. Since electronic music is such an abstract genre of music, sometime audience wonder what does a song really means and sometime they get lost in translation as oppose to what the artist think when they created the song. With music visualizer it helps artist deliver their message in a more intriguing and much clear-er way. I want to create a psychedelic, spiritual experience, or just simply evoke an emotion when the audience listen to a song. Or sometimes it just fun to look at animation while looking at music.</p2>
